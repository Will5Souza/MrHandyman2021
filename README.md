# MrHandyman2021


This is a project for my IWA CA2 @ CCT College in Dublin

The features in this application are: 
CRUD with Node.js
Deploying the app from Heroku
Creating and accessing a database on MongoDB Atlas

The Heroku link for this app is https://mrhandyman-app.herokuapp.com/

In order to run this application install the modules by typing: 

npm install -g
generate a link on mongodb atlas and create a file called .env
in the .env file create two variables 
- PORT = 8000
- DB_URL= <your atlas link>
Then you can test this application at the most
